			use = <"Use to record a description about subjective health-related observations or impressions from the point of view of the subject of care. 

When recorded by a clinician within the context of healthcare provision the story can be used for capturing the clinical history, as reported by the subject themselves, a parent, care-giver or other related party. If recorded by the subject, it can be used as an account of their 'story' of symptoms and health experiences, which might be used to share with healthcare providers or to document within their own personal health record.

Use:
- to record a simple narrative; and/or 
- as a container archetype to enable recording of a detailed structured history by inclusion of relevant CLUSTER archetypes within the 'Detail' SLOT. For example: CLUSTER.symptom, CLUSTER.issue or CLUSTER.health_event archetypes can be appropriately used in this SLOT.

Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical history captured from existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Story' text data element.">
