Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical Description' data element.

Specifically designed to be used within the CLUSTER.exam_ears archetype, but may be used within any clinically appropriate ENTRY or CLUSTER archetype related to physical examination of the ear.">

Not to be used to record stand-alone clinical observations or measurements - use specific OBSERVATION archetypes. For example OBSERVATION.blood_pressure, OBSERVATION.body_weight, or OBSERVATION.height.">
